Hm, this one may be a bit more tricky. You have only 35 lines to achieve the
goal, so you better use loops, loops everywhere !

Also, you can loops inside other loops. But then, you have to use different
incremented variables for the conditions (obviously). Maybe you could follow
the code that is already written could help you understand it a bit...
