	And now, the end is near
	And so I face the final curtain
	My friend, I'll say it clear
	I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
	I've lived a life that's full
	I traveled each and ev'ry highway
	And more, much more than this, I did it my way

La premiere personne qui trouve la chonson ET fini le niveau gagne un bonbon.
C'est motivant? ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
