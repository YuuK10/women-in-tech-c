Do you have a good memory ?
Archimede does. (Of course, it is Archimede.)

You can ask her to remember things by using VARIABLES.
Variables are kind of containers that will contain an information (a number,
a character, binary data, and so on...).

First, you need to tell her the name of your variable. This is called
VARIABLE DECLARATION, and you can to it this way :

	int name_of_my_variable;

A variable name should always start with a letter, and should only contain
lowercase or uppercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_).

You have then to give it a value. This is the funniest part.

	name_of_my_variable = 19

And BIM, name_of_my_variable now contains the best number of the world !
You will see a very practical example in the code of this level.
