Oh, damn ! It looks like Archimede the owl is stuck into a labyrinth.
She definitly needs your help to get out of it ! Would you please
tell her what she needs to do ? This is pretty easy, just write her
simple indications so she can follow them step by step.

By the way, she only understands the C language. Oh, you don't know it ?
Well... you better be a fast learner !

For each level of this game, you will have to follow a few steps :

	- Look at the level's map
	- Type the code
	- Test it
	- Type the code again (would't be fun if it was a one shot, right ?)
	- Retest it
	- ...
	- Did Archimede finally found a way out ? Great, then go to the next level.

To achieve this, you will need a few commands to type in the terminal (you know,
this ugly black window think where you can type text in) :

howtoplay	Well obviously, you already know it, since you're reading this.
		You should read the howtoplay for each level (like, really). It 
		may provide you some really nice informations to complete it.

editcode	This command will open the file where to write your code.

playgame	This one will... launch the game. Surprising, huh ? Of course,
		you may launch it once before typing the code, so you can see
		what the level looks like.

nextlevel	If Archimede got to the exit, you may type this command to go
		to the next level.

Pretty easy, isn't it ? 

Ok, no more speech, let's get into action. Leave this page by pressing the Q letter
on your keyboard, then type "editcode" (without the quotes, of course) in the
terminal, and let's make the magic happen together.
