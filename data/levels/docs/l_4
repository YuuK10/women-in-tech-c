You should be comfortable with the walk(direction) function know.
So let's add some challenge and new knowledge.

As you know there is two mode in vim -- INSERT -- and
the mode you use to save and quit (:wq).

When you are not in insert mode you can type several commande
and make some usefull action on your text. For example you
can delete one line by pressing two times 'd' ( dd ) and you can
delete multiple line by type the number of line before pressing
two times 'd' ( 10dd )

In this level you can't help archimede with useless word.. thanks
to Rick Asley... so be smart and try to keep instruction as clean
as possible.

Press Q to quit.
